Requirements

- AI-powered chat interface using the Gemeni API or another approved AI service.

- Secure API usage through a proxy server (we are front-end only, but you must not hardcode the API key in your client code).

- Semantic HTML with ARIA attributes for accessibility.

- At least some Tailwind CSS for styling, with an effort toward responsive design.

- JavaScript fundamentals must be clearly demonstrated:
  Custom function creation and invocation
  Variable creation
  An array of objects, looped over, rendering results to the DOM

- Presentation (screen share) in an interview style. You should be prepared to:
  Demonstrate the application (show how users interact with it).
  Answer questions about your code and the concepts covered.
  Explain any portion of the code you wrote. If you cannot explain it, you risk losing points.
